            I just wanted to take my time to explain why I decided to make a website
            like that. I decided to create this website as a hands-on project to
            deepen my understanding of core web development concepts, particularly
            how HTML, CSS, flexbox, and animations work together. My primary focus
            is on grasping how divs and layout properties interact, rather than
            getting caught up in design aesthetics. I believe that mastering the
            foundational concepts, including flexbox for layout and CSS animations
            for interaction, is essential at this stage. By prioritizing
            functionality and structure, I aim to build a solid base that will
            enable me to incorporate design elements more effectively in the future.
