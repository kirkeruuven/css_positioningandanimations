          I just wanted to take my time to explain why I decided to make a
          website like this. I created this website as a hands-on project to
          deepen my understanding of core web development concepts, particularly
          how HTML, CSS, flexbox, and animations work together. My primary focus
          is on grasping how divs and layout properties interact, rather than
          getting caught up in design aesthetics. I believe that mastering the
          foundational concepts, including flexbox for layout and CSS animations
          for interaction, is essential at this stage. By prioritizing
          functionality and structure, I aim to build a solid base that will
          enable me to incorporate design elements more effectively in the
          future.
